# Symbolic-Modeling-Drawing-Robot
The project was programmed using Python 2.7 with wxPython as graphical front end.
The aim of this project is to build interactively the kinematic chain of robot from library
of joints and rigid bodies and to output the table of geometric parameters . This involves
visualization of different parameters as well as local body fixed frames. The algorithms for
automatic arrangement of frames must obey modified Denavit Hartenberg notation rules .
The program must be able to visualize all the structures defned by SYMORO+ and should
be open-source. This program allows us to compare the software model with hand written
parameterization thereby reducing the possibilty of modeling errors .
